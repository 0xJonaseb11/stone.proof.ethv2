## How to Contribute

### Good First Issues

- Improve UI accessibility  

- Refactor frontend for clarity and consistency  

- Write unit tests for contracts  

- Add documentation and comments  

### Advanced Contributions

- Extend modular contract logic  

- Optimize gas usage  

- Add multisig logic or DAO governance hooks  

- Improve on-chain validation flow and events  

---

## Development Standards

- Linting: yarn lint  

- Formatting: Prettier (yarn format)  

- Commit messages: Use semantic commit messages:
  feat: add warehouse inventory verification
  fix: resolve tokenURI fetch issue
  chore: update walletconnect version

- Testing: Use Hardhat and Chai:
  yarn hardhat test

---

## Smart Contract Guidelines

- Use Solidity `^0.8.20` 

- Use OpenZeppelin libraries for security  

- Emit events on all critical state changes  

- Reuse errors from `Errors.sol`  

- Define shared types in `DataTypes.sol`  

- Interface-first development encouraged (interfaces/ folder)  

---

## Frontend Contribution

- Next.js 14 with App Router  

- Wagmi, Viem, WalletConnect for Web3 integration  

- Tailwind CSS and Shadcn/UI for UI components  

- Each portal validates role access on wallet connection  

- Maintain modular, reusable, accessible UI
